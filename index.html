                    <h3>HOPCAT</h3>
                    <p>
                    One of my go-to spots to grab late night food with my friends, you can never go wrong with Hopcat. If you're craving a burger accompanied by their renowned Cosmik Fries, take advantage of the Happy Hour to save some cash. Despite the wait times during peak hours, the vibrant atmosphere makes it a great for a lively hangout. Plus, the attentive staff ensures a great experience, adding to the appeal of this Ann Arbor gem.

                    <h3>CHAPALA</h3>
                    <p>
                    Chapala is my favorite Mexican restuarant in Ann Arbor. The decor in the restaurant is super fun and welcoming, they even have swings by the bar area. Although it gets loud inside, the vibes are great and the friendly staff make your meal a great one. My favorite dish here are the Birria Tacos; they come with rice and beans as well as a delicious consume for dipping.

                    <h3>FRITA BATIDOS</h3>
                    <p>
                    Frita Batidos is an beloved Ann Arbor classic. The restuarant, founded by former Top Chef contestant Eva Aronoff, is famous for their Fritas and Batidos, or Cuban burgers and milkshakes, but I also love their Garlic Cilantro Fries. It's open seating makes it a great place to bring friends and family and the service is always quick, despite how packed it gets. In the summertime, you can enjoy sitting on the patio with a nice cold batido and enjoy the live music that plays in downtown Ann Arbor.

                    <p>
                    I tried Stray Hen for the first time only a few months ago and needless to say it has quickly become one of my favorite brunch spots. The restaurant has Insta-worthy decor and food that not only tastes good but is also pretty. The food comes out fast and prices are pretty comparable to other brunch spots in Ann Arbor if not a little cheaper. Be sure to try their Waffle Flight!

                    <p>
                    This is my favorite spot for ice cream spot Ann Arbor. It is a bit far from campus but it's a nice walk in the summertime and the line always moves quickly. The ice cream is considerably more afforadable than anywhere else on campus and they have a great flavor selection. They are also known for their Maize and Blue sprinkle glaze donuts and you can always find them at various events on campus.

                    <h3>SADAKO</h3>
                    <p>
                    Sadako is a great restaurant for not only sushi but also other Japanese foods. When I'm not in the mood for a  Sadako roll, I love to get the Katsu Donburi - the portion is huge so I always take home leftovers! The interior of the restaurant is on the smaller side but it's worth the wait and the affordable price for good sushi.

                    <p>
                    Amer's is a cherished local spot offering a diverse menu and a cozy atmosphere. I love their Acai Bowls but they are also known for their hearty sandwiches, fresh salads, and delicious soups, making it a go-to for satisfying lunch options for students and locals alike. The deli's welcoming ambiance and friendly service add to the experience, making it a comfortable place to grab a quick bite or linger over a meal with friends.

                    <h3>FLEETWOOD DINER</h3>
                    <p>
                    Going to Fleetwood at 2am is something every Michigan student has to experience. It's an iconic spot, steeped in local history and renowned for its classic diner charm. The diner is a true gem for late night cravings and it does get crowded but it's worth the wait for their Hippie Hash â€” a hearty blend of hash browns, veggies, feta cheese, and other savory ingredients that's a must-try for anyone.

                    <h3>ZINGERMAN'S DELI</h3>
                    <p>
                    The sandwiches might be $20 but I think most people would agree that it's worth every penny. As soon as you step inside, the aroma of freshly baked bread and the hustle and bustle of the deli's activity immediately captivate your senses. The menu at Zingerman's is a treasure trove of artisanal sandwiches, each one crafted with care and bursting with flavor. From the classic Reuben to innovative creations, every bite feels like a gourmet adventure. Make sure you also try their famous Magic Brownies!
