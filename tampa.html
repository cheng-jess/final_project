                    <p>
                    Although Jeni's is a nationwide chain, I didn't discover it until my family moved to Tampa. What makes them stand out is their wide selection of unique flavors including my favorites Brambleberry Crisp and Powdered Jelly Donut. One of the locations in Tampa is in Sparkman Wharf so you'll often find yourself enjoying Jeni's in the middle of live music, a movie nights, or watch parties. The quality of Jeni's ice cream is unparalleled. It's rich, creamy, and perfectly balanced in sweetness, making each flavor profile distinct and memorable. Plus, they cater to various dietary needs with options like dairy-free and vegan selections that maintain the same level of flavor and creaminess.

                    <p>
                    The moment I land in Tampa, my first stop is always grabbing food at Lorita's, a hidden gem for those seeking authentic Mexican cuisine in the area. The standout feature of Lorita's lies in the freshness of its ingredients and friendlyness of the staff. The flavors are bold and the ingredients are vibrant ensuring a satisfying meal every time. The homemade salsas and sauces add an extra layer of depth to the already delicious dishes. My favorite item is the Carne Asada Chimichanga and not to mention, the portion sizes are generous!

                    Although this restuarant isn't technically in Tampa, it's only a short drive away in Clearwater Beach and the views are beautiful, especially at sunset. I had some of the best fries of my life here and the outside seating allows you to see all the cute dogs that walk by.

                    <p>
                    This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Tampa, bringing Southern comfort food to a whole new level with its delectable biscuit-centric menu.

The restaurant's ambiance exudes a cozy and inviting vibe, creating a welcoming space that feels like a gathering spot for friends and families, and from the moment you step inside, you're greeted by sweet smell of biscuits and syrup fills your. You can't really go wrong with any dish but my favorite is The Squawking Goat which was featured on Food Network!
