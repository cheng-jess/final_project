                    <h3>PITTSFORD DAIRY</h3>
                    <p>
                    No summer day is complete without a trip to Pittsford Dairy. The dairy's homemade ice cream steals the show, boasting an array of flavors that cater to every palate. Its welcoming atmosphere and friendly service also make it a great spot to go with friends and family. I love their cookies 'n cream ice cream, but also be sure to try their chocolate milk. You might even see a Buffalo Bills player or two in August during their training camp!

                    <p>
                    Simply Crepes is a great place to grab a meal with friends. Located right in village of Pittsford, you can also go on a nice walk along the Erie Canal afterwards. Whether you prefer the sweetness of Nutella and fresh fruit or the savory delights of ham and cheese, each crepe is expertly crafted and bursting with deliciousness. Be sure to check this place out when you're in town!

                    <p>
                    You might not expect Rochester, NY to have a good barbeque restaurant of all places but without a doubt this is one of the best I've had. From the moment you step inside, the aroma of smoked meats fills the air, setting the stage for a mouthwatering meal. The menu at Dinosaur BBQ features a tantalizing array of smoked meats, from tender ribs to juicy brisket. The sauces, ranging from tangy to spicy, add an extra punch to the already flavorful dishes. And don't overlook the sides, which I might argue I prefer over the main dishes â€” classic favorites like mac and cheese, coleslaw, and cornbread perfectly complement the main courses.

                    <p>
                    This local boba shop is a great place to hangout with friends and grab a drink and sushi burrito, poke bowl, or ramen. Their ingredients are always fresh and the vibes are good. They also have a wide assortment of board games to play with your friends and fun playlist going in the background. I like their taro milk tea paired with a poke bowl and would reccomend it to everyone.

                    <p>
                    Pi Craft Pizza offers a fresh and innovative take on the classic pizza experience. What sets Pi Craft apart is its build-your-own concept, allowing diners to create their personalized pizzas from scratch. What I like about this place is that the pizza is cooked quickly and you know that everything on it will be of liking to you. The restaurant's modern and sleek ambiance provides a casual and welcoming atmosphere. It's an ideal spot for families, groups of friends, or individuals seeking a quick and delicious meal.

                    Fattoush Restaurant opened in early 2023 but it's definitely become one of the fastest growing restaurants in Rochester. Everything on the menu from the chicken shwarma to the falafel is authentic and delicious. The ingredients are fresh, everything is flavorful, and you certainly won't be dissapointed. You'll feel great supporting a small business as well as enjoy a delicious meal.

                    Whenever I go home, my friends and I always grab brunch at Village Bakery & Cafe. It's a charming spot that exudes warmth from the moment you walk in.
